# SPARQLify
### Generate SPARQL queries for lexicographical data
---

This project aims to create an easy and interactive tool for non-technical users who would like to run SPARQL queries on lexicographical data on [Wikidata](https://query.wikidata.org/) and [Dbnary](http://kaiko.getalp.org/sparql).

The project started with [this simple blog post](https://sinaahmadi.github.io/posts/sparql-query-generator-for-lexicographical-data.html). Motivated by the positive feedback that I received and convinced that this tool can facilitate writing queries for many, I am planning to complete this project as follows:

 1. Make the generator more configurable. 
 2. Generate SPARQL queries from natural text (ongoing)
